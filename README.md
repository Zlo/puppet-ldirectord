## Overview

There was not an ldirectord puppet module.  So here one is.

## Module Description

Installs ldirectord from the mainteners website, from puppet source, 
or from package. Provides new type, to configure load balancer entries.

## Setup

### What ldirectord affects

* Installs ldirectord in /usr/sbin/
* Installs all needed perl modules,
* Installs ipvsadm

### Setup Requirements **OPTIONAL**

* pluginsync = true is required.
* puppetlabs concat module required
* puppetlabs stdlib required.

### Beginning with ldirectord

To get started you can simply define a vritual host

     ldirectord::virtual_host { "servicename-80":
       name         => "servicename-80",
       virtual      => "192.168.xx.xx",
       real         => [ "192.168.xx.xx", "192.168.xx.xx" ],
       real_options => "gate",
       port         => '80',
       service      => 'http',
       request      => '/lb.html',
       receive      => 'up',
       protocol     => 'tcp',
       scheduler    => 'wlc',
       checktype    => 'negotiate',
       persistent   => '900',
     }

The above defined by itself will include the ldirector class 
and give you an /etc/ldirector.cf file that looks like so:
#Managed by puppet using ldirectord module.

    checkinterval=15
    checktimeout=15
    autoreload=no
    quiescent=yes
    logfile="/var/log/ldirectord.log"
    virtual=192.168.xx.xx:80
        real=192.168.xx.xx:80 gate
        real=192.168.xx.xx:80 gate
        service=http
        request="/lb.html"
        receive="up"
        scheduler=wlc
        protocol=tcp
        checktype=negotiate
        persistent=900

Unfortantly every entry you add you will need to increment the entrynumber,  
this is required because the concat module is used to prepare the the config file


## Usage

The defaults should be enough to get you started with a global options config but no 
virtual hosts.

if you want to edit the default global oiptions you can do so like so:

    class { ::ldirectord:
      #Install Options
      download_location = 'http://horms.net/projects/ldirectord/download/ldirectord-latest',
      package_name      = 'ldirectord',
      #Global Options
      configfile_path   = '/etc/ldirector.cf',
      checkinterval     = '15',
      checktimeout      = '15',
      connecttimeout    = undef,
      negotiatetimeout  = undef,
      checkcount        = undef,
      autoreload        = 'no',
      callback          = undef,
      quiescent         = 'yes',
      logfile           = '/var/log/ldirectord.log',
    }

Note:  If you want to install ldirectord from a package rather then the maintaners website,  change download location to package,  
       If you want to install from a puppet file,  change to puppet and place the ldirectord file you want to use in the file directory

Defining a service the following options are available:

      ldirectord::virtual_host { "servicename":
        entrynumber,
        name,
        virtual,
        real,
        real_options,
        port,
        service,
        protocol,
        scheduler,
        fallback = undef,
        fallback_options = undef,
        fallback_port = undef,
        checktype = undef,
        checkport = undef,
        checkcommand = undef,
        checktimeout = undef,
        checkinterval = undef,
        failurecount = undef,
        httpmethod = undef,
        virtualhost = undef,
        login = undef,
        passwd = undef,
        database = undef,
        request = undef,
        receive = undef,
        checktype = undef,
        netmask = undef,
        persistent = undef,
      }
